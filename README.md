# keras-craft
Extremely easy to use Text Detection module with CRAFT pre-trained model.

keras-craft aims to be production ready and supports features like batch inference (auto batching for images of different size) and tensorflow serving.




# To Do:

1. Train different models for different use-cases. (various languages ..)
2. Experiment with smaller model(s)
